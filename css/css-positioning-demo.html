    <p class="t40-l10 gold">Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
    <p class="t20-r30 lightpink">Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
    <p class="b25-r20 forestgreen">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    <p class="t20-r30 skyblue">Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</p>
    
    <p class="b15-l30 forestgreen">Because their words had forked no lightning they</p>
    <p class="t20-r30 gold">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    <p class="b25-r20 skyblue">Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright.</p>
    <p class="t40-l10 lightpink">Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</p>
    
    <p class="t40-l10 skyblue">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    <p class="t20-r30 lightpink">Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
    <p class="b15-l30 forestgreen">And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</p>
    <p class="b25-r20 gold">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    
    <p class="b15-l30 forestgreen">Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
    <p class="t40-l10 skyblue">Blind eyes could blaze like 4 meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    <p class="t20-r30 lightpink">And you, my father, there on the sad height,</p>
    <p class="b25-r20 gold">Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</p>
    
    <p class="b15-l30 gold">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    <p class="t20-r30 forestgreen">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
