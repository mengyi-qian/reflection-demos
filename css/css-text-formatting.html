    <p class="">Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
    <p class="sans-serif">Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
    <p class="cursive">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    <p class="fantasy">Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</p>
    <p class="monospace">Because their words had forked no lightning they</p>
    <p class="italic">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    <p class="capitalize">Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright.</p>
    <p class="uppercase">Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</p>
    <p class="bold">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    <p class="line-through">Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
    <p class="underline-overline">And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</p>
    <p class="dotted-underline">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    <p class="word-spacing">Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
    <p class="letter-spacing">Blind eyes could blaze like 4 meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    <p class="color">And you, my father, there on the sad height,</p>
    <p class="background-color">Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</p>
    <p class="solid-text-shadow">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    <p class="soft-text-shadow">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
